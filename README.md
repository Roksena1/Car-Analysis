## The Goal
To clean, transform, and analyze a dataset of car specifications and pricing to uncover market trends and relationships.

## Description of the Project
This project focused on using Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis of a car dataset. The dataset included details like car make, model, engine specs, fuel types, and prices.

## Key Tasks

Cleaned and handled missing data, standardized text formats, and filtered cars from 1995 and later.
Created new features, such as Total MPG and Price per Horsepower, to support deeper analysis.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize key trends in car pricing, horsepower, and market size.

## Skills

Data cleaning and transformation (Pandas, NumPy)
Exploratory analysis and descriptive statistics
Correlation analysis
Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Technology: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Key Insights

Discovered strong correlations between engine horsepower and car prices.
Showed that larger vehicles and premium market segments command higher prices.
Highlighted efficiency trends across different transmission types.
